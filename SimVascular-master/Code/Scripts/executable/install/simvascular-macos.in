# This is a short-term fix for the cursor offset problem. The long-term fix will be 
# to redo the CPack installer build.
#
# The sv executable needs to be in the Contents/MacOS directory or else a library
# needed for correct cursor location is not loaded correctly. The executable is  
# not able to resolve library locations in placed in the Contents MacOS directory 
# so we create a soft link to it.
