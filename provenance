New releases of the self deployed PM3-SV components are handled by Dr. SR Kharche (Lawson Health Institute), 
in consultation with Dr. Daniel Goldman and Dr. C. W. McIntyre. Before each release any tests for the component 
or service are run to verify integration. New additions and features to the code base must pass all current tests 
and approved by the lead developer. New additions by users will be fully tested and documented by the developer team. 
After release, the developer team will provide support for the use of existing and new functionality. Each release will 
be accompanied by commits and changelog updates on their respective git/GitHub repositories. The third-party software 
and libraries are kept locked at specific versions. The PM3-SV components will receive updates when these libraries are 
updated for specific improvements.
