This is the 1D solver. Use cmake-gui and compile.
This is much simpler than SimVascular-master, and is an independent
binary. Actually, its a collection of binaries.
After build, the svSolver-build directory has scripts:

mypost		mypre		mysolver	mysolver-nompi

which appear to run the actual binaries with all paths set up.
